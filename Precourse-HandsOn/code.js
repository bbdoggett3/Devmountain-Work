    //KEYWORD LABEL -- this is the declaration

    //let and const are like var but more specific.

    const hello = "Hello"; //this cannot be changed.
    hello = "World"; //This will throw an error
    // When you are debugging make sure to look for the word
    //"TYPEERROR" in the console, this will give you a start
    // to debugging.

    //Both of these forms of declaring and assigning a value are
    //used in programming and either on is ok.
