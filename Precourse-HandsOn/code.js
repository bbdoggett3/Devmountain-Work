    //KEYWORD LABEL = VALUE
    var name = "Benjamin";

    //KEYWORD LABEL -- this is the declaration
    //LABEL = VALUE -- this is the assignment hence the equal sign.
    var email;
    email = "bendog@gmail.com";

    //let and const are like var but more specific.

    const hello = "Hello"; //this cannot be changed.
    hello = "World";

    //Both of these forms of declaring and assigning a value are
    //used in programming and either on is ok.
