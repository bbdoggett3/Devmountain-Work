//This will hold my practical skills involved with arrays

//What is an array? And how to create one
let myFriends = ['Jeremy', 'Missy', 'Brek'];   //this is the syntax of an array
let singleFriend = myFriends[1]; // you can look up a friend at any index from 0-2

//You can use push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, slice
myFriends.push('Brian'); // adds to the end of the array
myFriends.pop(); // removes friend at the end of the array
myFriends.shift(); //removes at the front of the array
myFriends.unshift('Jeremy'); //Add someone to the front of the array
myFriends.splice(0, 1) // start the splicing (removing) at index 0 and only move 1 space
let copy= myFriends.slice(1, 2) //started copying the array at index 1 (missy) and up to index 2 but not included
