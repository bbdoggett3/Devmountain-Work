Arrays:

DevMountain Definition: Type of data that store multiple values in an organized and structured fashion.

Online Definition: Special variable that stores multiple values in a single variable. You could just put it in 1 var but then 
that would make it hard to loop through. We want arrays since it makes it easier to access the data we store inside our variable 
(think of it like a container).

Arrays can hold more than one piece of information unlike other variables.
