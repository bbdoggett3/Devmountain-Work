Computational Thinking: is learning to solve problems the way that a computer would, in order to 
be better at programming.

Computer are fast but dumb
Humans are slow but smart

Humans learn from experience, but we need to learn how to give the computer direction

3 things to remember about computational thinking:
•	Decomposition: break the problem down into steps
•	Pattern recognition: By finding patterns we can sped up the programming process by reusing it.
•	Creating algorithms: set of steps that is going to make the same output every time. You need to 
be specific in designing these algorithms. All large problems are just small steps combined. 

Break things down.

You struggle with computational thinking cause you forget to break things down. You want to 
tackle everything head on, and you don’t need too, break it down… This is good advice for any 
aspect of your life.
