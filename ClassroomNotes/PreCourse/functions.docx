Functions:

A function is a set of actions that are assigned a name by a programmer, and that a computer can
be called upon to perform at any point after the function has been defined. It’s a primary 
organizational tool for us as developers

Functions allow us to use the data we’ve stored in a simple way.

Functions act a lot like a variable. However, rather than a single piece of data it can be an 
entire block of code.
