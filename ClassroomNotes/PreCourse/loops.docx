Loops:

Loops are a way to tell your computer to execute a piece of code over and over, until it reaches youâ€™ve given it.

As long as the condition is meet it will continue to run it over and over again. They can be a powerful tool if done correctly.
It is conditional. If it is true it will continue to run, once the condition is false it will move on with the code.

They are flexible. Think of an Ice cream example. Remember it Ben?

Iterations are important in a loop because without them then you would be in a loop indefinitely. This iteration is done with 
incrementation like this for example: i++
