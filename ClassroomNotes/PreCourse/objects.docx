Objects: (THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN PROGRAMMING AND SHOULD UNDERSTOOD BEN)
They are a data type, stored in a single variable, that can store a collection of individually 
indexed pieces of data.
They are a collection of other data. In other wordâ€™s it allows you to store multiple variable in a
single variable. They are like a box that can hold multiple things. They are the most common 
construct we will use in this class.
In the box we put in an identifier or commonly known as a key
Key: is the label and the value is the data that we are attaching to the label (string, int, array,
ect.)

The sntax looks something like this... 

var person = {                 //The curly braces hold the information inside the object and then we label it.
  name: "Ben Doggett",        
  age: 27,
  state: "Idaho",
  city: "Rexburg"
}

We can access the things inside our little box(object). In order to do that we need to use a '.' (dot/period)
An example of this looks like the following:

person(accessing the object).(reaching into the container/object)name(grabing the variable/label holding the data)
Example: person.name
